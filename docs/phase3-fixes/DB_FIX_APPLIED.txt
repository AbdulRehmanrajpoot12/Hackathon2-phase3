DATABASE CONNECTION FIX APPLIED ✅

File Modified: backend/db.py

Changes:
- Added QueuePool for connection pooling
- pool_pre_ping=True (tests connections before use)
- pool_recycle=3600 (recycles connections every hour)
- TCP keepalives configured
- Connection timeout and retry logic

IMPORTANT: Backend server must be restarted for changes to take effect.

To restart backend:
1. Stop current backend (Ctrl+C in backend terminal)
2. Restart: cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080

This will fix the 'SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly' error.
